# Script-for-Auto-Installing-of-Dependencies
Most of the programming languages have tools to manually define project dependencies and simple command line interfaces to download those dependencies. For example Java have Maven and NodeJs have npm. In Java we define pom.xml and in npm we use package.json. You need to build a tool to automatically download python packages. 

Note1: If scripting in Python,Pip version should be 9.0.1.

Note2: Script is written for Windows Operating System.For Ubuntu OS, just make a change in the code at cmd = "sudo pip install "
